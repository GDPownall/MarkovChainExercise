# MarkovChainExercise
An exercise writing a class to simulate Markov-chain events and two examples of games which can use it: Monopoly and Gambler's Ruin.  
Functionality includes simulating the state of an event at any time, including infinite steps (the stationary state) with the accuracy of a non-compounded floating-point error (ie. without the use of event-by-event monte carlo).

This repository is well documented in the docs/ folder. 
For recruiters and other interested people, I recommend ``MarkovChains.pdf'' for an overview and the .gif files for animations of how the Gambler's Ruin and Monopoly games evolve with time.
