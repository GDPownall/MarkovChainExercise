# MarkovChainExercise
An exercise creating a markov chain class, and some examples using it.

This repository is well documented in the docs/ folder. 
For recruiters and other interested people, I recommend ``MarkovChains.pdf'' for an overview and the .gif files for animations of how the Gambler's Ruin and Monopoly games evolve with time.
